<p>Me and the dog version of Sir Pheles made our way to Cram School. He handed me this key and said I could use it on any door and it would allow me to get into the Cram School building. When I tried the key it worked, it kinda reminded me of the key father fujimoto had used to hide my sword, but not quite the same. I entered the door, it was a long kinda dimly lit hallway with a bunch of colors everywhere. He told me the first year's class was in 1106 so that is where we started to walk. As we came up on the door I was a little nervous but I was ready to start my journey to becoming an exorcist so I just took a leap of faith and opened the door. When I opened the door the first thing I noticed was how run down the room looked, I mean in my mind this wasn’t what I had expected from a “state of the art” school, but the classroom didn’t really matter so much as who I'd be learning from and with. There were about 7-8 other students, most of them were boys and just 2 girls, and then this person that was wearing a hood. I couldn’t really make out who they were, but it didn't really matter that much. I was just excited to meet new people and learn. I must’ve been talking or murmuring rather but it seemed like Sir Pheles had heard me and said “well exorcists are always few in number.” It made sense to me, I couldn’t argue with the guy who got me in here. Then a voice crept in saying “quiet down class”, so it seemed like the teacher was coming. I was curious as to see who would be teaching not just me but everyone else in my class the art of exorcism, but nothing could have prepared me for who I was going to see. It was Yukio, my brother. I mean I knew he’d been an exorcist but my teacher, no way. Me and him are the same age and you're telling me he was going to teach me how to be an exorcist?? That's crazy, just absolutely crazy. I was surprised, my mind was blown, my younger brother was the top student ANDDDD a teacher. Just madness. I wanted to talk to him but I didn’t know what to say. He started teaching us about temptaints which were wounds inflicted by demons, and that every sorcerer needed one to be able to see demons, but something was just boiling up inside of me. I didn't know if it was anger or confusion or both but I had to talk to him. So I yelled at him and told me to tell me what the hell was going on. He tried to play it off as cool and that just irritated me even more so my yelling just got louder and louder until he told the others to step out of the classroom for a minute while me and him had a talk. </p>
