<p>I punched him, and as much as you hear me say I didn’t I did. He was talking about my brother. Any other reasonable person would’ve done the same, after I punched him his lackeys jumped all over me. Even when I was down that guy just kept on talking about my family not having money like he was trying to get me all riled up. He pulled a knife on me, he was babbling about how “everyone shaves their head for an interview, how about I help you” or something like that. I honestly don’t even remember it clearly enough. I was too focused on that knife in his hands. Even his stupid goons thought he was going too far and at that moment I couldn’t have agreed more with them. As he got closer to my face a blew flame shot out from my body. I was puzzled, questioning what the hell just happened. As I was just standing there the only thing I could understand him saying was “satan has been waiting for this”. I had never been the super religious type even though I was raised by a priest but I knew satan was bad news and to stay away from anything related to it, and as I was thinking to myself father fujimoto came out of nowhere like a superhero. It sounded like he was saying a bible verse of some sort and after he finished it was like he had killed the demon. He told me that it seemed like the guy was possessed but honestly I was still trying to put the pieces together of how fire shot out from my body. Father Fujimoto was so calm and he was trying to explain to me what was going on. He said something about how I could see demons and there being 2 worlds: Assiah and the other, the bad one Gehenna, where demons supposedly lived. I was trying to understand but I just couldn't. He rushed me to get up and said I’d understand soon enough and that news of my awakening was going to spread.</p>
