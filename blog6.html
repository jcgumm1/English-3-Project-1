<p>“The son of satan.. an exorcist! Most interesting, I like it.” That’s what I kinda remember him saying but it’s foggy to be honest. I said “So it’s okay for me to be an exorcist?” He said something like how I had chosen the thorny or rough path, it was something like that. I proclaimed that I would be an exorcist and take down satan. When we went back to the monastery, Yukio seemed to know this mephisto guy. I mean it made sense he was an exorcist. I was still bothered by how everyone knew for so long, they knew my whole life and I was just oblivious living without a care in the world, but nonetheless I knew now and I was certain I had finally found my purpose. Mephisto started talking about school. I didn’t think school was what it took to become an exorcist. I agreed to go because I wanted to make father fujimoto proud and yukio was going with me so it couldn’t be all that bad. We got in the limo in all its pink glory?? This guy mephisto really does love his colors. It's kinda freaky. On the ride to the school I didn’t really talk to yukio, I couldn’t figure out if he was mad at me or something. All these thoughts rushed through my head. Like how would I explain how father fujimoto died and what he’d think of me after. As I was so enveloped in my own thoughts, Sir Pheles informed us that we had just made it to the school, True Cross Academy. It was amazing, like no building I had ever seen. It looked just about like I would never need to leave the campus town; it had literally everything I’d ever need or even wanted. When the limo was coming to a halt Sir Pheles said that the entrance ceremony was about to begin soon and that he’d talk to me after it. I was doubting that this school was really for exorcists. It was so fancy and it looked like all the stuck up rich kids went here. I kinda felt out of place, but sometimes you need to be out of your element to be great. That feels like something father fujimoto would say lol.</p>
