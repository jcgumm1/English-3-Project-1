<p>I had just gotten home from a job interview and of course father fujimoto was on my tail again babbling about “you need a job” this and “you can’t depend on me forever” that. We got into what some would call a scream off lol. From what I remember it was our usual yelling at each other back and forth but when I got mad the heater flared up, i didn’t know why. After that I went to my room. My twin brother Yukio came in to check on me. He told me that he was worried about me just like how father fujimoto was. In the moment I told him to screw off but truth be told I felt what he said, coming from my brother I knew I needed to get my life together. The next day I put on some nice clothes and a tie. I couldn't figure out how to tie the damned thing. I walked around the church and found father fujimoto and he snickered at me and made jokes about when I was little calling out “father, father , father”. I was weirded out but he tied my tie and I was on my way to the job interview. I started to walk around the city going towards my destination, but I saw something weird like it was a demon calling out to me but it looked like someone i knew. I had to keep whipping my eyes, I was in disbelief at what I was seeing. It was the pigeon killers, they were back but this time trying to apologize for what they had done?? I was confused and scared it looked like he was turning into a demon. He had horns and even a tail and there were these black fuzzy floating  things around his body but nonetheless I entertained the conversation, but then he said something about yukio, it really pissed me off as much as I joke around and act like I can’t stand my brother, he means the world to me and I could never just stand there and let someone talk about him like that.
