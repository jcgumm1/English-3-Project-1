<p>I asked why he didn’t tell me sooner. He said he’d wanted to raise me as a normal child,but I didn’t care because now to me it seemed like everyone I cared about was in danger just because of me. I went off on father fujimoto. It was like he was abandoning me and not trying to protect me. I said something I shouldn't have. I said “don’t ever pretend to be my father ever again.” I didn’t realize how big of a price I'd have to pay after saying something so foolish. He smacked me. I immediately realized what I had said and went to go grab my things to leave the church, but something happened father fujimoto keeled over. He said get away from him but I didn’t know what was going on. His voice changed like it got deeper like an entirely different person, he was possessed. By Satan himself the church workers said. He started talking about his reunion with me and me being his long lost son. I just stood there, but right after he said “it seems even this guy's body is starting to give out”. He ripped off some skin and blood dripped to the ground. Some gate appeared he called it “the gate to gehenna”. He grabbed the kuma sword. He said he should destroy it to release the spell and reveal my true nature. I tried to snatch it from him and more blue flames appeared. He joked around and said “ what was that did you piss your pants or something”. I guess he was trying to joke about my flames being small, I didn't even understand how I summoned them in the first place. As he kept talking to me he started to waiver. I started to hear father fujimoto’s voice. He stabbed himself. Satan talked again, “you damned exorcist, you're stronger than you seem, willing to risk your own life all for this boy.” He said the gate wouldn’t let us go even if Satan were to give up his possession. I looked for a way out, I saw my sword and I drew it. I felt this power that I had never felt before, my sword glowing with a blue flame. I slashed the gate and I pulled me and father fujimoto’s lifeless body from it. After that I collected myself. I remembered the phone father fujimoto gave me and I called the number on it. People with masks all around me appeared in a flash, and a man with a giant top hat and colorful clothes appeared.</p>
