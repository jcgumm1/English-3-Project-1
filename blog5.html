<p>The man with the top hat walked forward and said “My name is Mephisto Pheles, I was a friend of father fujimoto’s.” I was still kinda bothered by what had just happened back at the monastery, but the only thing going through my mind was if these guys all around me were really friendly or if they were enemies. I mean they had black cloaks and masks for crying out loud, what else was I supposed to think. After he finished talking I asked “So.. so are you guys exorcists?” The guy with the hat, I think Mephisto was his name, said they were nights of the true cross. Whatever that meant, but nonetheless they were not attacking me so I couldn’t be mad. I said “Father Fujimoto said you’d take me in.” He said “despite my appearance I'm in a position of some sort of responsibility.” I don’t really know what he was talking about at the moment, I just wanted to know if he’d take me in and help me. He said “you are the son of satan, so therefore I must kill you before you become a threat to humanity.” I was taken aback, this guy or rather these guys were supposed to help me, but now it seems like they’re trying to kill me. Mephisto said “You have two options. You let us kill you or… You kill us. So which will it be?” I thought about it, I was contemplating letting them kill me, but I remembered father fujimoto in that moment, he didn’t die for me just so I could die hours later. He wanted me to live, so I'm going to. “Let me join you,” I said. “Whatever you guys say, I am not satan’s son. My true father was father fujimoto.” He asked why I’d even wanted to be an exorcist. Truth be told I didn’t even really know at that moment, but I knew one thing and it’s that I wanted to kick satan’s ass. So I said that. He started laughing hysterically, I wasn’t surprised I was kinda questioning myself when I said it but I stood firm on what I said.</p>
