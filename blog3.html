<p>On the way back to the church I kept asking and begging father fujimoto to explain what was going on, and why what seemed to be a demon just attacked me. After minutes of constant asking it seemed like he finally just snapped and said, “The child of a demon, born of a woman and fathered by a demon.” I was confused at first but he wasn’t finished, “not just any demon” he said “but you are the bastard child of satan himself”. I was in disbelief, I couldn’t believe what he had just told me. Me the child of satan, the big bad demon I used to get read stories about when I was little. I just couldn’t even begin to understand what this meant for me. Would the people back at the church hate me, would father fuji moto treat me differently, would yukio my own brother hate me?? All of these thoughts raced through my mind and we reached the church. Father rushed in and started packing a bag for me and threw it at me. Everything was happening so fast I pleaded to stay with him at the church but he kept talking about my safety and other stuff that I wasn’t even listening to. He handed me a key. I think it was called the “kamishikoshi” ot “kamishikasho” . I don't know, I couldn’t remember the name of it for the life of me. He said with the key I could hide anything I want with it and he pulled a sword out of the trunk in the dresser. He called it the “koma sword”. He said it contains all of my flames and if I ever drew it, it would reveal my demonic nature, and that I could never live as a human again. I was scared, distraught, perplexed, any word you could think of. I was feeling those exact emotions at that moment. I said “demon this demon that, is this some kind of joke???” Then I worried about my brother. He and I were twins so was he the same as me? Father Fujimoto then explained that I was the first born so I only inherited the demon's power.</p>
