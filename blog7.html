<p>Yukio and I went to the auditorium for the entrance ceremony. The auditorium was huge and there were so many new students a long with Yukio and me. As it began a loud speaker spouted out “Welcome your new student representative; Yukio Okumora!” I was shocked, I mean I knew my brother was smart but this smart that’s insane! I heard people whispering about how great and smart he was, it brought me back to when me and yukio would be in the playground and he’d get picked on. I had to help him all the time lol. It showed me how far my younger brother had really grown, I had never really noticed up until now. This just pushed me to be better, I mean I can’t let my little brother be this much better than me. Although I felt that way I was still ecstatic for my brother, I always want him to succeed even if it’s without me. In that moment I truly understood why father fujimoto brough Yukio into the fold about being an exorcist and not me. After the ceremony I walked around for a little. Sir Pheles popped in out of nowhere, I asked “Now how do I become an exorcist?” He said he appreciated my enthusiasm but that I needed to take this in steps. He then said I needed to attend “Cram School” . I didn't know what that meant at first when he said it but then he further explained. “Cram School is the school that you will be studying exorcism at, as a page, regular highschool starts in two days, but Cram School, well that starts today.” He then said “but a word of warning to you, It is a secret that you are the son of satan.” He also stated that I had to keep my tail, ears, and teeth hidden, and as for my flame,he just said to keep it under control. I said I’d try because to be honest I don’t know what the trigger to activating my flame really is. He was still worried so he told me he was going to observe my class today, and then he transformed into a dog??? </p>
